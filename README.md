# sql-challenge

## Background

In this project, I designed a SQL database to hold a hypothetical company's employee information. The assignment is proken into two parts: 
1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis

### Data Engineering

A table schema is created for six CSV files, and each CSV file is imported into its corresponding SQL table. 

### Data Analysis

The following tasks are accomplished to analyze the employee data: 

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
